# Introduction to Udemy Apache Spark 2.0 with Scala - Hands On with Big Data!

## About this course

Dive right in with 20+ hands-on examples of analyzing large data sets with Apache Spark, on your desktop or on Hadoop!

## Brief Description

New! Updated for Spark 2.0.0.

“Big data" analysis is a hot and highly valuable skill – and this course will teach you the hottest technology in big data: Apache Spark. Employers including Amazon, EBay, NASA JPL, and Yahoo all use Spark to quickly extract meaning from massive data sets across a fault-tolerant Hadoop cluster. You'll learn those same techniques, using your own Windows system right at home. It's easier than you might think, and you'll be learning from an ex-engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.

Spark works best when using the Scala programming language, and this course includes a crash-course in Scala to get you up to speed quickly. For those more familiar with Python however, a Python version of this class is also available: "Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python - Hands On".

Learn and master the art of framing data analysis problems as Spark problems through over 20 hands-on examples, and then scale them up to run on cloud computing services in this course.

* Learn the concepts of Spark's Resilient Distributed Datastores
* Get a crash course in the Scala programming language
* Develop and run Spark jobs quickly using Scala
* Translate complex analysis problems into iterative or multi-stage Spark scripts
* Scale up to larger data sets using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service
* Understand how Hadoop YARN distributes Spark across computing clusters
* Practice using other Spark technologies, like Spark SQL, DataFrames, DataSets, Spark Streaming, and GraphX

By the end of this course, you'll be running code that analyzes gigabytes worth of information – in the cloud – in a matter of minutes.
