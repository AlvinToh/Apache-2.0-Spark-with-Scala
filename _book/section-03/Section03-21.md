# 21. [Exercise] Check your Results, and Sort Them by Total Amount Spent

### Activity
* You can get the answer from TotalSpentByCustomer.scala where it shows the code for getting the total amount spent by each customer
* I have included my code PurchaseByCustomer.scala which shows my solution

### But Wait! There's More!
* Now sort your results by amount spent!
* Review our sorted word count example - it's the same idea.

### Exercise
* Instead now sort the list starting with the customer with the largest amount of total purchase, which you can also sort by ascending or descending
* I have included the sorting code inside PurchaseByCustomer.scala
