# 16. [Activity] Running the Minimum Temperature Example, and Modifying it for Maximum

### Activity
* For this activity, you will be looking at 1800.csv from the resource folder
* Copy 1800.csv into SparkScala folder
* Open up Eclipse-Scala IDE and import MinTemperatures.scala into SparkScalaCourse Project
* If you open MinTemperatures.scala, it contains the codes that we talked about previously in our lecture
* Create a new Run Configuration and put as MinTemperatures for Name and main class as com.sundogsoftware.spark.MinTemperatures and run it
* You should be able to see the min temperatures for the stationID now

### Exercise
* The first exercise is finding out the maximum temperatures instead of minimum.
* The file MaxTemperatures.scala is included in this folder for your reference

* The second exercise is actually finding out what date has the most precipitation and create a script based modifying MaxTemperatures.scala
* The file MaxPrecipitation.scala is included in this folder for your reference
